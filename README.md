# get_out

JavaScript CLI RPG game that can be played in the console using Node.js <br />
You start in a room and you have to escape <br />
Interact with the objects in the room via the choices presented to you and try and make your way out <br />

To begin, ensure you have the node module dependencies installed, and then simply run the main.js file using Node.js by typing 'node main.js' in to your terminal <br />

This project was developed using mob programming remotely via Zoom screen share <br />
Collaboration tools such as ClickUp and LucidChart were used for brainstorming, visualising and developing ideas, and creating a board to create a product backlog, assign cards to members, and track progress. <br />
